          I'm Sojonwo Tolulope Adeife, better known as TheToluAdeife. I'm a
          budding Software Developer with a passion for technology and the arts.
          I'm currently diving headfirst into the world of AI after a thrilling
          six-week crash course. I'm also a med student at the University of
          Lagos, so I'm always juggling multiple passions! I'm skilled in HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always looking for new challenges to
          learn from. When I'm not coding or studying, you might find me lost in
          a symphony of violin strings or crafting intricate crochet
          masterpieces. I'm also aspiring to be a gynecologist and I'm learning
          software development at Sidmac Technologies to build a website that
          will help medical students, doctors, and patients. So, if you're
          looking for a creative, tech-savvy, and slightly chaotic individual,
          you've found your person. Let's build something amazing together!
